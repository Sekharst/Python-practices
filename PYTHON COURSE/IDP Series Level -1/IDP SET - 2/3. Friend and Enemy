A group F friends visited a haunted house. Each member was wearing a shirt with a number on it ranging from 
1 to F. As they entered the haunted house, one of them was kidnapped and an enemy replaced him.

Rather than wearing the same shirt number as the kidnapped one, the enemy wore a shirt with the same number
as another person among the remaining people.

Write a program that reads the F space-separated numbers and prints the numbers on the shirt of the enemy 
and the person who was kidnapped.

Input
The input will be a single line containing space-separated integers representing all the people 
who are currently in the house, from 1 to F.

Output
The output should be a single line containing space-separated integers representing the numbers on 
the shirt of the enemy and the person who was kidnapped.

Explanation
Test Case 1: If the given numbers = 3 1 5 2 1

In the range from 1 to 5, the number 1 has occurred has occurred twice and the number 4 is missing.
So, 1 is the enemy's shirt number, and 4  is the person's shirt number who was kidnapped.

The output should be 1 4

Sample Input1:
3 1 5 2 1
Sample Output1:
1 4

Sample Input2:
1 2 2 4
Sample Ouput2:
2 3

Solution:

def get_enemy_and_kidnapped_person_shirt_numbers(shirt_numbers):
    total_shirts = len(shirt_numbers)
    kidnapped_person, enemy = None, None
    
    for each_shirt_number in range(1, total_shirts + 1):
        if (shirt_numbers.count(each_shirt_number) == 2):
            enemy = each_shirt_number
            
        if (shirt_numbers.count(each_shirt_number) == 0):
            kidnapped_person = each_shirt_number
        
    return enemy, kidnapped_person

def main():
    shirt_numbers = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    enemy, kidnapped_person = get_enemy_and_kidnapped_person_shirt_numbers(shirt_numbers)
    enemy, kidnapped_person = str(enemy), str(kidnapped_person)
    print(enemy + " " + kidnapped_person)
    
main()
