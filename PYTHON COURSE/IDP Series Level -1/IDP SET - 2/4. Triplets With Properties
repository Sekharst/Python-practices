Shikhar has two integers S and T. He wants to count all possible triplets of non-negative integers (a,b,c) which
satisfy the below conditions:
a + b + c <= S and a x b x c <= T

Your task is to help Shikhar by finding the count of such triplets.

Write a program that reads the two space-separated numbers S and T, and prints the count of 
triplets of non-negative integers (a,b,c) satisfying the above conditions.

Note: A group of three, considered as a unit is known as triplet.

Input
The input will be a single line containing space-separated integers representing S and T.

Output
The output should be a single line containing an integer representing the count of triplets of non-negative integers 
(a,b,c) satisfying the above conditions.

Explanation
TestCase: If the given S=1 and T=0

Possible triplets which are satisfying the above given conditions are (0,0,0) (0,1,0) (0,0,1) (1,0,0)

The output should be 4.

Sample Input1
1 0
Sample Output1
4

Sample Input2
2 5
Sample Output2
10

Solution:

def get_triples_count(s, t):
    triples_count = 0 
    for a in range(s + 1):
        for b in range(s + 1):
            for c in range(s + 1):
                if (a + b + c <= s and a * b * c <= t):
                    triples_count += 1  
    return triples_count
    
def main():
    s, t = map(int, input().split())
    triples_count = get_triples_count(s, t)
    print(triples_count)
    
main()
