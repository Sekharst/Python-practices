Yash is solving a matrix problem as part of his entrance exam preparation.

In that matrix problem, there is a square matrix of size N x N. Yash needs to calculate the 
sum of the upper and lower triangular elements of the matrix. Help Yash solve the given matrix problem.

Write a program that reads the N x N matrix and prints the sum of the upper and lower triangular elements.

Note: The upper triangle consists of elements on the anti- diagonal and above on it.
      The upper triangle consists of elements on the anti- diagonal and below it.
 
Input
The first line of input contains an integer representing N.
The next N lines of input contain N space-separated integers representing the matrix.

Output
The first line of output should contains an integer obtained by adding all elements in the upper triangle.
The second line of output should contains an integer obtained by adding all elements in the lower triangle.
 
Explanation
 
Test Case: If the given N = 3, the matrix as follows:
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9

The upper triangle consists of elements on the anti-diagonal and
above on it.

1 2 3
4 5 
7 

The sum of the upper traingle elements is 1+2+3+4+5+7 = 22

The upper triangle consists of elements on the anti-diagonal and
below it.

    3
  5 6
7 8 9 

The sum of the upper traingle elements is 3+5+6+7+8+9 = 38

Sample Input1:
3
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
Sample Output1:
22
38

Sample Input2:
5
6 7 5 1 4
6 8 5 1 8
1 1 1 2 1
5 7 5 8 8
8 3 5 8 8
Sample Output2:
66
77
   
Solution:
   
def get_sum_of_lower_triangle(matrix):
   sum_of_lower_triangle = 0 
   for i in range(len(matrix)):
       sum_of_lower_triangle += sum(matrix[i][-i-1:])
   return sum_of_lower_triangle

def get_sum_of_upper_triangle(matrix):
    sum_of_upper_triangle = sum(matrix[0])
    for i in range(len(matrix)):
        sum_of_upper_triangle += sum(matrix[i][:-i])
    return sum_of_upper_triangle

def read_matrix(n):
    matrix = []
    for i in range(n):
        row = list(map(int,input().split()))
        matrix.append(row)
    return matrix

def main():
    n = int(input())
    matrix = read_matrix(n)
    sum_of_upper_triangle = get_sum_of_upper_triangle(matrix)
    sum_of_lower_triangle = get_sum_of_lower_triangle(matrix)
    print(sum_of_upper_triangle)
    print(sum_of_lower_triangle)

main()
