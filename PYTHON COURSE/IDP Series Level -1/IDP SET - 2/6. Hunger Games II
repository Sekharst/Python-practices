Your friend is hosting a game with N players. The players are seated around a circular table in chairs numbered from 1 to N
At the beginning of the game, the host randomly chooses a chair number S among the chairs numbered from 1 to N.
Beginning with the player in chair S, one chocolate will be handed to each player sequentially around the table 
until all of the M pieces of chocolates have been distributed.

The player who receives the last chocolate wins this game. Help your friend to find who is going to win.

Write a program that reads the N number of players, M pieces of chocolates and the randomly choosen chair number S
and prints the chair number of the player who received the last chocolate.

Input
The first line of input contains an integer representing the number of test cases T.
The next T lines of input contain three space-separated integers representing the N number of players, 
M pieces of chocolates and the randomly choosen chair number S

Output
The output should be a T lines, each line containing an integer that is the chair number of the player 
who received the last chocolate.

Explanation
If the given test cases T=2

TestCase1: If the given N=4, M=6 and S=2 (4 players, 6 peices of chocolates and 2 is the randomly choosen chair number)

There are 4 players seated around a circular table in chairs numbered from 1 to 4.
Chocolate distribution starts from chair 2.
One chocolate will be handed to each player sequentially around the table until all of the 6 chocolates have been distributed.
The player seated in chair 3 receives the last chocolate and going to win this round.

The output should be 3.

TestCase2: If the given N=1, M=1 and S=1 (1 players, 1 peices of chocolates and 1 is the randomly choosen chair number)

There are 1 players seated around a circular table in chairs numbered from 1.
Chocolate distribution starts from chair 1.
One chocolate will be handed to each player sequentially around the table until all of the 1 chocolates have been distributed.
The player seated in chair 1 receives the last chocolate and going to win this round.

The output should be 1.

Solution:

def get_winning_chair_number(no_of_players, chocolates, start_position):
    current_chair_position = start_position
    chocolates -= 1
    while(chocolates != 0):
        current_chair_position += 1
        chocolates -= 1
        if(current_chair_position > no_of_players):
            current_chair_position %= no_of_players
    return current_chair_position
def main():
    t=int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        no_of_players, chocolates, start_position = map(int, input().split())
        winning_chair_number =  get_winning_chair_number(no_of_players, chocolates, start_position)
        print(winning_chair_number)
main()
