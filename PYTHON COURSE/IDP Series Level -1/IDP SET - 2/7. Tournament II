Your friend wants to find the prize money of Mary Kom. Your task is to determine the prize money of Mary Kom 
in the World Boxing Championship.

Write a program that reads a number X representing the base prize pool and a string of length 14 
consisting of the characters A,M and D, representing the result of 14 matches. A denotes Amanda won the match, 
M denotes Mary Com won the match, and D denotes a draw and prints the total amount earned by Mary Kom.

Input
The first line of input contains an integer T representing the number of test cases.

The next T lines of input contain 

The first line of input contains an integer X representing the base prize pool.
The second line of input contains a string representing the results of the 14 matches. A denotes Amanda won the match, 
M denotes Mary Com won the match, and D denotes a draw and prints the total amount earned by Mary Kom.

Output
The output should be a T lines,  lines containing an integer representing the prize money received by Mary Kom.

Explanation
If the given test cases T=2

TestCase1: If the given X=300, results= ADDAADDDAADADA

The total prize pool is 30000 as 100*X
Among 14 matches, 7 matches won by Amanda and 7 matches are draw, So Amanda is champion.
So the Marycom is loser, She gets 40*X, i,e 12000

The output should be 12000.

TestCase2: If the given X=400, results= AMMMMAMDMADMAD

The total prize pool is 40000 as 100*X
Among 14 matches, Amanda has won 4 matches. Marycom has won 7 matches and 3 matches are draw, 
So Marycom is champion.
So the Marycom is winner, She gets 60*X, i,e 24000

The output should be 24000.
