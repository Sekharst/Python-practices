The N students in the class have recently finished a science viva exam and received their results from the teacher. 
They are standing in the order in which they took the exam, each holding their results in hand.

The teacher asked the students to note the number of students who took the viva after them and received a lower score. 
Your task is to help students.

Write a program that reads N space-separated viva scores of students and prints the number of students who took the viva 
after them and received a lower score.

Input
The first line of input contains an integer representing the number of students N.
The second line of input contains N The second line of input contains S.

Output
The output should contain N space-separated integers representing the number of students who took the viva after 
each student and received a lower score.

Explanation
Test Case: If the given N = 3 and S = 13 12 11
Score of student 1 is 13.
Score of student 2 is 12.
Score of student 3 is 11.
The number of people who took the viva after student 1 and scored less than 13 is 2 (12, 11).
The number of people who took the viva after student 2 and scored less than 12 is 1 (11).
The number of people who took the viva after student 3 and scored less than 11 is 0.

The output should be 2 10.

Sample Input 1
3
13 12 11
Sample Output 1
2 1 0

Sample Input 1

4 3 5 2
Sample Output 1
2 1 1 0

    counts_of_students = []
    for i in range(no_of_students):
        students_count_with_less_score = 0
        for j in scores[i+1:]:
            if (scores[i] > j):
                students_count_with_less_score += 1 
        counts_of_students.append(students_count_with_less_score)
    return counts_of_students

    counts_of_students = get_counts_of_students(no_of_students, scores)
    print(*counts_of_students)
