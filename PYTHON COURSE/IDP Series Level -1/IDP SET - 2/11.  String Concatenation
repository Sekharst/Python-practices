Disha has been given three strings A, B, and C consisting of
lowercase alphabets, and a number T consisting of digits 1, 2, and 3.

The teacher asked Disha to concatenate the three strings A, B, and C based on the order of digits in the given number T.

• The digit 1 represented the string A.
• The digit 2 represented the string B.
• The digit 3 represented the string C.

Help Disha arrange the strings based on the order of digits in the given number T.

Write a program that reads the strings A, B, C and a number T and prints the resultant string.

﻿

Input
The first line of input contains a string representing A.
The second line of input contains a string representing B.
The third line of input contains a string representing C
The fourth line of input contains an integer representing T.

Output
The output should be a single line containing a string obtained by concatenating the strings 
A, B and C based on the order of digits in the given number T.

Explanation
Test Case: If the given A = mari, B = to, C=zzo and T = 1321

Concatenate these in the order A+C+B+ A based on the order of digits in the given number T.

So the resultant string is marizzotomari.

The output should be marizzotomari

Sample Input 1
mari
to
zzo
1321
Sample Output 1
marizzotomari

Sample Input 1
abra
cad
abra
123
Sample Output 1
abracadabra

Solution

def get_concatinated_word(words, t):
    concatinated_word = ""
    for each_number in t:
        index = int(each_number) - 1
        concatinated_word += words[index]
    return concatinated_word

def read_words(no_of_inputs):
    words = []
    for i in range(no_of_inputs):
        word = input()
        words.append(word)
    return words

def main():
    words = read_words(3)
    t = input()
    concatinated_word = get_concatinated_word(words, t)
    print(concatinated_word)
    
main()
