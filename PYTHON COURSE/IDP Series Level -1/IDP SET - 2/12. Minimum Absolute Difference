There are N pyramids in a line. Given their heights, your task is to find the minimum absolute difference 
between the heights of any two different pyramids.

 Write a program that reads the N space-separated heights of the pyramids and prints the minimum absolute 
 difference between the heights of any two different pyramids.
 
 Input
 The input will be a single line containing space-separated integers representing the heights of the N pyramids.
 
 Output
 The output should be a single line containing the minimum absolute difference between the heights 
 of any two different pyramids.
 
 Explanation
 TestCase: If the given N = 7 1 5
 The absolute difference between the heights of any two different pyramids are
 
 Pyramid-A    Pyramid-B   Pyramid-C
   7              1           6
   7              5           2
   1              5           4
   
   From the above table, the minimum absolute difference is 2.
   
   The output should be 2.
   
   Sample Input1:
   7 5 1
   Sample Output1:
   2
   
   Sample Input2:
   5 9 2 0 3
   Sample Output2:
   1
   
   Solution:
   
   def get_min_absolute_difference(pyramid_heights):
    min_absolute_difference = abs(pyramid_heights[1] - pyramid_heights[0])
    for i in range(len(pyramid_heights)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(pyramid_heights)):
            difference = abs(pyramid_heights[i] - pyramid_heights[j])
            if(difference < min_absolute_difference):
                min_absolute_difference = difference
    return min_absolute_difference

def main():
    pyramid_heights = list(map(int,input().split()))
    min_absolute_difference = get_min_absolute_difference(pyramid_heights)
    print(min_absolute_difference)

main()
