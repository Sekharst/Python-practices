Aman loves solving matrix problems. In one problem, he was given a MX N matrix and instructed to:

• Identify the zeros and replace them with the sum of neighbouring elements (top, bottom, left and right elements).

• Once all the zeroes are replaced, all the other elements in the corresponding row and column of those 
identified zeroes should be set to zero (excluding the elements which were previously zeros).

Aman got stuck with this problem and your task is to help Aman solve this matrix problem.

Write a program that reads the M x N matrix and prints the final matrix by following the above instructions.

Input
The first line of input contains two space-separated integers representing M and N respectively.
The next M lines of input contain N space-separated integers representing the matrix.

Output
The output should be M lines containing N space-separated integers representing the final MX N matrix 
by following the above instructions.

Explanation
Test Case: 1 If the given M = 3 and N = 3, the matrix is as follows:
1 4 3
5 Ө 2
2 2 8

The position of 0 is (1, 1). Replace (1, 1) with the sum of neighbouring elements.

Positions         Neighbour Elements        Sum
(1, 1)              4+2+5+2                  13

All the other elements in the corresponding row and column of the identified zero should be set to 0 
(excluding the element which is previously zero). 

The output should be,

1 0 3
0 13 0
2 0 8

Test Case: 2 If the given M = 4 and N = 3, the matrix is as follows:
0 1 2
2 1 0
0 2 3
1 0 1

The position of 0 is (0, 0), (1, 2), (2,0),(3,1) replace with the sum of neighbouring elements.

Positions         Neighbour Elements        Sum
(0, 0)                1+2                    3
(1, 2)                2+1+3                  6
(2, 0)                2+2+1                  5
(3, 1)                2+1+1                  4

All the other elements in the corresponding row and column of the identified zero should be set to 0 
(excluding the element which is previously zero). 

The output should be,

3 0 0
0 0 6
5 0 0
0 4 0

Sample Input1:
3 3
1 4 3
5 0 2
2 2 8
Sample Output1:
1 0 3
0 13 0
2 0 8

Sample Input2
4 3
0 1 2
2 1 0
0 2 3
1 0 1
Sample Output2
3 0 0
0 0 6
5 0 0
0 4 0
