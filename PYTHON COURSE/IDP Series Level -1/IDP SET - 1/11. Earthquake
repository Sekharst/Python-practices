Question: 
Shreya has been given two different earthquake magnitudes A and B  and her task is to find how many times earthquake 
A  is more powerful than earthquake B

She knows that when the magnitude of an earthquake increases by 1, the amount of energy multiplies by 32. 
Help Shreya in determining the intensity of earthquake A compared to earthquake B 

Write a program that reads the magnitudes of earthquakes A and B  and prints the number of times earthquake A
 is more powerful than earthquake B

Input:
The input will be a single line containing space-separated integers representing the magnitudes of the earthquakes A and B

Output:
The output should be a single line containing an integer obtained by calculating the number of times earthquake A
 is more powerful than earthquake B

Explanation:

TestCase: If the given A=6 and B=4
The difference between 6 and 4 is 2, Since, the magnitude of an earthquake increases by 2,
the amount of energy multiplies by 32x32

32x32=1024

earthquake A is 1024  times more powerful than the earthquake B

The Otput should be 1024

Sample Input 1:
6 4
Sample Output 1:
1024

Sample Input 2:
5 5
Sample Output 2:
1

Solution:

def get_the_amount_of_energy(magnitude_a, magnitude_b):
    magnitudes_difference = magnitude_a - magnitude_b
    amount_of_energy = 32 ** magnitudes_difference
    return amount_of_energy

def main():
    magnitude_a, magnitude_b = input().split()
    magnitude_a, magnitude_b = int(magnitude_a), int(magnitude_b)
    amount_of_energy = get_the_amount_of_energy(magnitude_a, magnitude_b)
    print(amount_of_energy)

main()
