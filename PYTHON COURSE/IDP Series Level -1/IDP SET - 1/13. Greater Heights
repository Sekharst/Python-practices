Question: 
Arun is in a class with N students. He has been assigned the responsibility of measuring the 
height of each student in the class.

After completing the above-mentioned task, the teacher asked him the Q  queries. In each query, he will be given a number X
and his task is to find the number of students in the class who have a height of at least X.
Help Arun by answering his teacher's queries.

Write a program that reads N  students' heights and Q queries asked by the teacher and prints the answers to each query.

Input:
The first line of input contains space-separated integers representing number of students N and number of queries Q.
The second line of input contains N  space-separated integers representing the heights of N students in the class.
The next Q lines of input contain an integer value representing each query X asked by the teacher. 

Output:
The output should be Q lines containing an integer obtained by calculating the number of students in the class 
who have a height of at least X on each line.

Explanation:

TestCase: If the given N=3, Q=1 and heights = 100 160 130
In this example we have 3 students in the class and 1 query has been asked by the teacher
For the given query 120, the number of students that have a height of at least 120 are 2.

The output should be 2

    answer = 0
    for each_height in students_heights_list:
        if(each_height >= query):
            answer += 1
    return answer

    for each_query in queries_list:
        answer = get_answer_to_the_query(students_heights_list, each_query)
        print(answer)
def main():
    no_of_students, no_of_queries = map(int, input().split())
    students_heights_list = get_students_list(no_of_students)
    queries_list = get_queries_list(no_of_queries)
    answer_the_queries(students_heights_list, queries_list)
