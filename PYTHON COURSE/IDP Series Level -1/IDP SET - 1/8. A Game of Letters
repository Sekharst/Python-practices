Question: 
Sophia is given a sentence and asked to make every word in the sentence start with a vowel.
In order to do this, she can rotate the letters in the words from left to right. 
Help Sophia update the words in the sentence.
Write a program that reads the sentence and prints the updated sentence by performing the above operation.

Note: If there is no vowel in word, then the letters will not rotate

Input:
The input will be a single line containing a string representing the sentence.

Output:
The output should be a single line containing a string that is updated by making every 
word start with a vowel in the given sentence.

Explanation:

TestCase: If the given sentence= "A boy carrying bag slipped on floor"

Original Word       Rotated Word
  A                     A
  boy                   oyb
  carrying              arryingc 
  bag                   agb
  slipped               ippedsl
  on                    on
  floor                 oorfl

The should be "A oyb arryingc agb ippedsl on oorfl"

Sample Input:
A boy carrying bag slipped on floor

Sample Output:
A oyb arryingc agb ippedsl on oorfl

Solution:

def get_new_word(word):
    vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']
    new_word = word
    word_length = len(word)
    for i in range(word_length):
        if word[i].lower() in vowels:
            new_word = word[i:] + word[:i]
            break
    return new_word

def get_new_sentence(sentence):
    new_sentence = ""
    for word in sentence:
        new_word = get_new_word(word)
        new_sentence += new_word + " "
    return new_sentence

def main():
    sentence = input().split()
    new_sentence = get_new_sentence(sentence)
    print(new_sentence)
    
main()
