Question: Arjun has two strings S and T. In order to equal them, he can select any two adjacent characters in S
 and swap them only once.
 Write a program that reads two strings and checks if Arjun can make the given two strings equal or not.
 
Input:
The first line of input contains a string representing S.
The second line of input contains a string representing T.
Output:
The output should be a single line containing a string. Yes  should be printed if the given two strings are equal 
after swapping any two adjacent characters in S, Otherwise No should be printed.

Explanation:
TestCase 1: If the given S=abc T=acb.
Arjun can swap the 2nd and 3rd characters of the string S and equal the given two strings.
The output should be Yes

TestCase 2: If the given S=aabb T=bbaa.
Arjun cannot equal the given two strings S amd T  by performing the operation at once.
The output should be No.

Sample Input 1:
abc
acb
Sample Output 1:
Yes

Sample Input 2:
aabb
bbaa
Sample Output 2:
No

Solution:

def check_words_for_equality(first_word_list, second_word_list):
    if (first_word_list == second_word_list):
        return "Yes"
    else:
        return "No"

def swap_characters_and_check_words_equality(first_word, second_word):
    first_word_list, second_word_list = list(first_word), list(second_word)
    for i in range(len(first_word_list) - 1):
        if (first_word_list[i] != second_word_list[i]):
            temp = first_word_list[i]
            first_word_list[i] = first_word_list[i + 1]
            first_word_list[i + 1] = temp
            break
    are_words_equal = check_words_for_equality(first_word_list, second_word_list)
    return are_words_equal

def main():
    first_word, second_word = input(), input()
    result = swap_characters_and_check_words_equality(first_word, second_word)
    print(result)

main()
