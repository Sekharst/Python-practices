Question: 
A shopkeeper records all purchases at the end of the day. He has prices for all the purchases 
that happened at the shop today. He wants to know which item got sold only once and which item 
got sold more than once.

Write a program that reads the space-separated prices and prints the price of items that sold 
only once and more than once.

Note: In the case of ties, choose the price of the item that was sold earlier in the day.

Input:
The input will be a single line containing space-separated integers representing the prices of the purchases.

Output:
The first line of the output should contain an integer that is the price of an item that is sold only once.
The second line of the output should contain an integer that is the price of an item that is sold more than once.
Print None  if no purchase meets the given criteria.

Explanation:

TestCase: If the given puchases=5 5 4 7 4 1 11
The price of the item that got sold only once earlier in the day is 7
The price of the item that got sold more than once earlier in the day is 5

The Otput should be
7
5

Sample Input 1:
5 5 4 7 4 1 11
Sample Output 1:
7
5

Sample Input 2:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
Sample Output 2:
1
None

Solution:

def get_item_sold_only_once(prices_list):
    item_sold_only_once = None
    for each_price in prices_list:
        if (prices_list.count(each_price) == 1):
            item_sold_only_once = each_price
            break
    return item_sold_only_once

def get_item_sold_more_than_once(prices_list):
    item_sold_more_than_once = None
    for each_price in prices_list:
        if (prices_list.count(each_price) > 1):
            item_sold_more_than_once = each_price
            break
    return item_sold_more_than_once

def main():
    prices_list = input().split()
    sold_only_once = get_item_sold_only_once(prices_list)
    sold_more_than_once = get_item_sold_more_than_once(prices_list)
    print(sold_only_once)
    print(sold_more_than_once)

main()
