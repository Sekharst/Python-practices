Question: 
Write a program that reads the numbers N, M space-separated numbers and prints the sum of numbers
whose position is divisible by N . Consider that the positions of the numbers starts from 1 to M.

Input:
The first line of input contains the space-separated integers representing N and M.
The second line of input contains M  space-separated integers representing the numbers.

Output:
The output should be a single line containing an integer that is the sum of all the numbers
whose position is divisible by N

Explanation:

TestCase1: If the given N=1, M=7 and the numbers = 4 8 6 6 7 9 3 

numbers     4 8 6 6 7 9 3 
positions   1 2 3 4 5 6 7

All the positions are divisible by 1
4+8+6+6+7+9+3=43
The should be 43

TestCase2: If the given N=4, M=13 and the numbers = 7 3 10 4 5 8 4 9 6 9 10 1 4

numbers     7 3 10 4 5 8 4 9 6 9  10  1   4
positions   1 2  3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11  12 13 

positions 4,8,2 are divisible by 4
4+9+1 =14
The should be 14

Sample Input 1:
1 7
4 8 6 6 7 9 3
Sample Output 1:
43

Sample Input 2:
4 13
7 3 10 4 5 8 4 9 6 9 10 1 4
Sample Output 2:
14

Solution:

def get_nth_number_sum(numbers, divisible_number):
    sum_of_numbers = 0
    for each_position in range(1, len(numbers) + 1):
        if(each_position % divisible_number == 0):
            sum_of_numbers += numbers[each_position - 1]
    return sum_of_numbers

def main():
    divisible_number, numbers_length = map(int, input().split())
    numbers = list(map(int, input().split()))
    nth_number_sum = get_nth_number_sum(numbers, divisible_number)
    print(nth_number_sum)

main()
