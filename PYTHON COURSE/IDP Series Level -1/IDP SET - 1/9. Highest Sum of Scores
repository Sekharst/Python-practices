Question: 
Professor Michael gave an assignment to his students. The professor divided the students into N groups 
after they completed the assignment and he would like to know which group achieved the highest score.

You will be given N groups' assignment scores and your task is to help Professor to know which group of students 
achieved the highest score on their assignments.

Write a program that reads the N group of comma-separated assignment scores and prints the group
that achieved the highest score.

Input:
The first line of input contains an integer representing the number of groups N.
The Next N lines of input contain comma-separated integers representing the N  group of students assignment scores.

Output:
The output should be a single line containing space-separated numbers representing the group
that achieved the highest score.

Explanation:

TestCase: If the given N=2 and the groups are
0,1,2
3,1,0

In the above 2 groups, The second group (3, 1, 0) has the largest sum, 4.

The output should be 3 1 0

Sample Input 1:
2
0,1,2
3,1,0
Sample Output 1:
3 1 0

Sample Input 2:
3
12,11,13
14,15,16
10,58,95
Sample Output 2:
10 58 95

Solution:

def get_group_with_highest_score(groups_list):
    group_with_highest_score = groups_list[0]
    for each_group in groups_list:
        if(sum(each_group) > sum(group_with_highest_score)):
            group_with_highest_score = each_group
    return group_with_highest_score
    
def read_groups(groups):
    groups_list = []
    for i in range(groups):
        group = list(map(int, input().split(',')))
        groups_list.append(group)
    return groups_list
 
def main():   
    groups = int(input())
    groups_list = read_groups(groups)
    group_with_highest_score = get_group_with_highest_score(groups_list)
    print(*group_with_highest_score)

main()
