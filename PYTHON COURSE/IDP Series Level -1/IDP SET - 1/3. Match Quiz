Question:

Riya participated in a math quiz competition. At the end of the contest,she had to solve a tricky question 
to win the first prize

She has been given a few numbers, M multiple ranges and her task is to add all the numbers in each corresponding range. 
Help Riya to solve this question.

Write a program that reads the space-separated numbers and M  multiple ranges and prints the sum of all
the numbers in each range.

Input

The first line of input contains space-separated integers representing numbers.
The second line of input contains an integer representing the multiple ranges M.
The next M lines of input contain space-separated integers representing the each range.

Output:
The output should be M lines containing an integer that is the sum of all the numbers in the given range.

Explanation:

TestCase: If the given numbers 1 2 2 3 3 3 4 5 6 and M=2
For range 0 2 , the numbers within the range of 0 to 2 are 1 2 2
The sum of all the numbers in given range is, 1+2+2=5

For range 1 4 , the numbers within the range of 1 to 4 are 1 2 2 3 3 3 4
The sum of all the numbers in given range is, 1+2+2+3+3+3+4=18
The output should be
5
18

Sample Input 1:
1 2 2 3 3 3 4 5 6
2
0 2
1 4
Sample Output 1:
5
18

Sample Input 2:
6 6 14 20 8 -2 2 -3
4
1 2
2 5
3 6
0 4
Sample Output 2:
2
2
12
2

Solution:

def get_the_sum_of_numbers(numbers, from_range, to_range):
    sum_of_numbers = 0
    for each_number in numbers:
        if each_number >= from_range and each_number <= to_range:
            sum_of_numbers += each_number
    return sum_of_numbers
def print_sum_of_numbers_for_multiple_ranges(numbers, no_of_ranges):
    for i in range(no_of_ranges):
        from_range, to_range = map(int, input().split())
        sum_of_numbers = get_the_sum_of_numbers(numbers, from_range, to_range)
        print(sum_of_numbers)
def main():
    numbers = list(map(int, input().split()))
    no_of_ranges = int(input())
    print_sum_of_numbers_for_multiple_ranges(numbers, no_of_ranges)


main()
