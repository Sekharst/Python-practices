Question: 
A group of people are playing a game. Each person stands in a line and holds a card with a number on it.
You will be given a random number S  and your task is to find

The updated group of people after removing the S number of people from the left side of the group.
The updated group of people after removing the S number of people from the right side of the group.

Write a program that reads the card numbers and a random number S
and prints the updated group of people in two lines after removing the S
number of people from the left and right sides of the group.

Input:
The first line of input contains comma-separated integers representing the card numbers.
The second line of input contains an integer representing the random number S

Output:
The first line of output contains space-separated integers that is the updated group of people after removing the S
 number of people from the left side of the group.
 The second line of output contains space-separated integers that is the updated group of people after removing the S
 number of people from the right side of the group.

Explanation:
TestCase: If the given numbers=1,2,3 and S=1, 

After removing 1  number from the left of the group, we will have: numbers= 2 3
After removing 1  number from the right of the group, we will have: numbers= 1 2 

The output should be
2 3
1 2

Sample Input 1:
1,2,3
1
Sample Output 1:
2 3
1 2

Sample Input 2:
0,12,4,3,4,12,0
3
Sample Output 2:
3 4 12 0
0 12 4 3

Solution:

def main():
    card_numbers = list(map(int, input().split(',')))
    random_number = int(input())

    card_numbers_with_removed_left_numbers = card_numbers[random_number:]
    card_numbers_with_removed_right_numbers = card_numbers[:len(card_numbers) - random_number]

    print(*card_numbers_with_removed_left_numbers)
    print(*card_numbers_with_removed_right_numbers)

main()
