Question: 
Akshay has been given a few numbers. In the given numbers, every number except one will appear twice.
Your task is to identify the number that appears exactly once.
Write a program that reads the space-separated numbers and prints the number that appears exactly once.

Input:
The input will be a single line containing space-separated integers representing numbers.

Output:
The output should be a single line containing an integer, which is a number that appears only once.

Explanation:

TestCase: If the given numbers = 2 2 1
The should be 1

Sample Input 1:
2 2 1
Sample Output 1:
1

Sample Input 2:
8 9 2 8 9 2 5
Sample Output 2:
5

Solution:

def get_number_appeared_exactly_once(numbers):
    for number in numbers:
        if(numbers.count(number) == 1):
            return number

def main():
    numbers = input().split()
    number_appeared_exactly_once = get_number_appeared_exactly_once(numbers)
    print(number_appeared_exactly_once)

main()
