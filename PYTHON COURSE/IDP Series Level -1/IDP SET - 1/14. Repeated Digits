Question: 
Edward has been given a number that he must decode to obtain a PIN. He is required to find the count of repeated 
single-digit integers in the given number in order to decode it. Your task is to help Edward obtain a PIN.

Write a program that reads the number and prints the count of repeated single-digit integers in the given number.

Input:
The input will be a single line containing an integer representing the number.

Output:
The output should be a single line containing an integer representing the count of
repeated single-digit integers in the given number.

Explanation:

TestCase: If the given N=212311
In this number, digits 1 and 2 are repeated single-digit integers. 
The count of repeated single-digit integers in the given number is 2.

The output should be 2.

Sample Input 1:
212311
Sample Output 1:
2

Sample Input 2:
111
Sample Output 2:
1

Solution:

def get_repeated_digits_count(number):
    repeated_digits = []
    for each_digit in number:
        if number.count(each_digit) > 1 and each_digit not in repeated_digits:
            repeated_digits.append(each_digit)
    repeated_digits_count = len(repeated_digits)
    return repeated_digits_count

def main():
    number = input()
    repeated_digits_count = get_repeated_digits_count(number)
    print(repeated_digits_count)

main()
