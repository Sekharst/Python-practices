01. Replace the Element

For this problem, the prefilled code will contain a list of tuples. Write a program to replace the last number 
of each tuple in the list with the given number (N).

Input:

The input will be a single line containing an integer (N).

Output:

The output should be a single line containing the list of tuples with the given number.

Explanation:

For example, if the given N is 50, your code should print the list of tuples by replacing the last number
of each tuple with 50. So the output should be

[(10, 20, 50), (1, 50), (5, 10, 15, 50)]

Sample Input 1:

50

Sample Ouput 1:

[(10, 20, 50), (1, 50), (5, 10, 15, 50)]

Sample Input 2:

80

Sample Ouput 2:

[(10, 20, 80), (1, 80), (5, 10, 15, 80)]

Question: Replace the Element

In this problem, you are given a list of tuples. Your task is to write a program that replaces the last 
number of each tuple in the list with a given number (N).

Approach
To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:

1.Read the input number (N).
2.Iterate through the list of tuples.
3.Replace the last element of each tuple with the input number (N).
4.Print the updated list of tuples.

Step-by-Step Explanation

Step 1: Read the input number
First, we need to read the input number (N) that will replace the last element of each tuple. We can use 
the input() function to read the input and int() to convert it into an integer.

Step 2: Iterate through the list of tuples
Now, we need to iterate through the list of tuples. We can use a for loop to do this. In each iteration, 
we will access the current tuple and perform the replacement operation.

Step 3: Replace the last element of each tuple
Inside the for loop, we will replace the last element of the current tuple with the input number (N). 
To do this, we can use the slicing operation to remove the last element of the tuple and then add the 
input number (N) as a new element.

After replacing the last element, we will append the updated tuple to a new list called new_list.

Step 4: Print the updated list of tuples
Finally, after iterating through all the tuples and replacing the last element, we will print the updated list of tuples.

Here is the complete solution for the problem:

Solution:

num_list = [(10, 20, 30), (1, 2), (5, 10, 15, 45)]

n = int(input())

new_list = []
for tuple_a in num_list:
    update_tuple = tuple_a[:-1] + (n,)
    new_list.append(update_tuple)

print(new_list)

02. Remove Duplicates

Write a program to remove duplicate numbers in the list.

Input:

The input will be a single line containing space-separated integers.

Output:

The output should be a single line containing the list without duplicates in ascending order.

Explanation:

For example, if the given string is "5 10 15 20 10 30 15", as the numbers 10 and 15 are repeated more than once, 
your code should remove the duplicate numbers. So the output should be

[5, 10, 15, 20, 30]

Sample Input 1:

5 10 15 20 10 30 15

Sample Output 1:

[5, 10, 15, 20, 30]

Sample Input 2:

-18 10 20 20 50 40 -18 50 60 20

Sample Output 2:

[-18, 10, 20, 40, 50, 60]

Question: Remove Duplicates

Write a program to remove duplicate numbers in the list.

Input: The input will be a single line containing space-separated integers.

Output: The output should be a single line containing the list without duplicates in ascending order.

Explanation: For example, if the given string is "5 10 15 20 10 30 15", as the numbers 10 and 15 are 
repeated more than once, your code should remove the duplicate numbers. 
So the output should be [5, 10, 15, 20, 30].

Approach

1.Read the input and split the numbers into a list.
2.Create a new list and convert the numbers to integers.
3.Remove duplicates using a set.
4.Sort the list and print the result.

Step-by-Step Explanation

Step 1: Read the input and split the numbers
Read the input value representing the space-separated integers. We can use the input() function to read 
the input and split() function to split the input into a list of strings.

Step 2: Create a new list and convert the numbers to integers
Create an empty list called new_list. Then, use a for loop to iterate through the num_list. For each item 
in the num_list, convert the item to an integer using the int() function and append it to the new_list.

Step 3: Remove duplicates using a set
To remove duplicates from the new_list, we can use a set. A set is a collection of unique elements. 
Convert the new_list to a set using the set() function, and then convert it back to a list using the list() function.

Step 4: Sort the list and print the result
Now, sort the num_list in ascending order using the sort() function. Finally, print the sorted list without duplicates.

Solution:

num_list = input().split()

new_list = []
for item in num_list:
    num = int(item)
    new_list.append(num)

new_set = set(new_list)
num_list = list(new_set)
num_list.sort()
print(num_list)

03. Remove Multiple Items

For this problem, the prefilled code will contain a set. Write a program to remove a list of numbers if present in the set.

Input:

The input will be a single line containing space-separated integers.

Output:

The output should be a single line containing the list of remaining numbers in ascending order.

Explanation:

For example, if the given string is "20 40 80", your code should remove the numbers(20, 40, 80) from the set.
So the output should be

[10, 30, 50, 60, 70, 90, 100]

Sample Input 1:

20 40 80

Sample Output 1:

[10, 30, 50, 60, 70, 90, 100]

Sample Input 2:

10 90

Sample Output 2:

[20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 100]

Question: Remove Multiple Items
Approach
Step 1: Read the input numbers
Step 2: Remove the input numbers from the set
Step 3: Sort and print the remaining numbers

Question: Remove Multiple Items
In this problem, you are given a set of numbers. Your task is to remove a list of numbers from the set 
if they are present in it. You will receive a single line of input containing space-separated integers. 
The output should be a single line containing the list of remaining numbers in ascending order.
So the output should be:

For example, if the given input is "20 40 80", your code should remove the numbers (20, 40, 80) from the set.

Approach

To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:

1.Read the input numbers as a list of strings.
2.Remove the input numbers from the set if they are present.
3.Sort the remaining numbers in the set.
4.Print the sorted list of remaining numbers.

Step-by-Step Explanation

Step 1: Read the input numbers
First, we need to read the input numbers as a list of strings. We can use the input() function to read the 
input and split() function to split the input string into a list of strings.

Step 2: Remove the input numbers from the set
Now, we will iterate through the list of input numbers and remove them from the set if they are present. 
We can use a for loop to iterate through the list and the discard() function to remove the number from the set.

Here, we first convert the string item to an integer num using the int() function. Then, we use the discard() 
function to remove the number num from the set num_set. If the number is not present in the set, the discard() 
function does nothing.

Step 3: Sort and print the remaining numbers
After removing the input numbers from the set, we need to sort the remaining numbers in ascending order.
We can convert the set to a list and use the sort() function to sort the list.

Finally, we can print the sorted list of remaining numbers.

Here is the complete solution for the problem:

Solution:

num_set = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100}

list_a = input().split()

for item in list_a:
    num = int(item)
    num_set.discard(num)

nums_list = list(num_set)
nums_list.sort()
print(nums_list)

04. Common Elements

Given two lines of comma-separated integers, write a program to print the numbers that are present in both of the lines.

Input:

The first line of input will contain comma-separated integers.
The second line of input will contain comma-separated integers.

Output:

The output should be a single line containing the list of common elements in both lists sorted in ascending order.

Explanation:

For example, if the given two strings are "1,2,3,4,5,6" and "2,4,5,9,10", your code should print the 
list of common elements. So the output should be

[2, 4, 5]

Sample Input 1:

1,2,3,4,5,6
2,4,5,9,10

Sample Output 1:

[2, 4, 5]

Sample Input 2:

20,5,-45,100,30
98,-45,20,5,35

Step 2: Convert the lists into sets
Step 3: Find the common elements
Step 4: Sort the common elements and print the result

Question: Common Elements
Given two lines of comma-separated integers, write a program to print the numbers that are present in both of the lines.

Approach

To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:

1.Read the input and convert it into lists of integers.
2.Convert the lists into sets.
3.Find the common elements between the two sets.
4.Sort the common elements and print the result.

Step-by-Step Explanation

Step 1: Read the input and convert it into lists
First, we need to read the input lines and convert them into lists of integers. We can use the input() 
function to read the input and split() function to split the input by commas.

Now, we need to convert the lists of strings into lists of integers. We can create a function called 
convert_string_to_int() that takes a list of strings as input and returns a list of integers.

Now, let's use this function to convert our input lists into lists of integers.

Step 2: Convert the lists into sets
Now that we have our lists of integers, we need to convert them into sets. We can use the set() function to do this.

Step 3: Find the common elements
Now that we have our sets, we can find the common elements between them. We can use the intersection() 
function to do this.

Step 4: Sort the common elements and print the result
Now that we have our common elements, we need to sort them in ascending order and print the result. 
We can use the sort() function to sort the list and the print() function to print the result.

Here is the complete solution for the problem:

Solution:

def convert_string_to_int(num_list):
    new_list = []
    for item in num_list:
        num = int(item)
        new_list.append(num)
    return new_list

list_a = input().split(",")
list_b = input().split(",")

list_a = convert_string_to_int(list_a)
list_b = convert_string_to_int(list_b)

set_a = set(list_a)
set_b = set(list_b)

result_set = set_a.intersection(set_b)
result_list = list(result_set)
result_list.sort()
print(result_list)

05. Multiplies of 2 and 3

Given an integer N. Write a program to create two sets with N multiples of 2 and 3 and print the following

  1. All the multiples of 2 but not the multiplies of 3
  2. Uncommon multiples of 2 and 3

Input:

The input will be a single line containing a positive integer (N).

Output:

The first line of output should be a single line containing a list with all the multiples of 2 but not 
the multiplies of 3 in ascending order.

The second line of output should be a single line containing a list with uncommon multiples of 2 and 3 in ascending order.

Explanation:

For example, if the given N is 5, the first 5 multiples of 2 and 3 are the following
multiples_of_2 = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10}
multiplies_of_3 = {3, 6, 9, 12, 15}

The first line of output should contain a list of all the multiples of 2 but not the multiples 
of 3, as 6 is a multiple of 3, print the list without 6. So the output should be

[2, 4, 8, 10]

The second line of output should contain a list of uncommon multiples of 2 and 3, as 6 is common 
in both the sets print a list with all the multiples of 2 and 3 without 6. So the output should be

[2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15]

Sample Input 1:

5

Sample Output 1:

[2, 4, 8, 10]
[2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15]

Sample Input 2:

10

Sample Output 2:

[2, 4, 8, 10, 14, 16, 20]
[2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 10, 14, 15, 16, 20, 21, 24, 27, 30]

Tutorial: Multiplies of 2 and 3

Lets try to breakdown the solution for the coding question "Multiplies of 2 and 3" into simple steps

Step 1: Understanding the Problem
Before we start coding, let's try to understand the problem. The problem statement says that we need to
create two sets with N multiples of 2 and 3, and then print out the following subsets:

1. All the multiples of 2 but not the multiples of 3
2. Uncommon multiples of 2 and 3

For example, if N is 5, the first 5 multiples of 2 and 3 are as follows:
multiples_of_2 = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10}
multiples_of_3 = {3, 6, 9, 12, 15}

The first subset should contain all the multiples of 2 but not the multiples of 3, which would be:
[2, 4, 8, 10]

The second subset should contain all the uncommon multiples of 2 and 3, which would be:
[2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15]

Now that we understand the problem, let's start coding!

Step 2: Writing the Code
The first thing we need to do is to get the value of N from the user. We will use the input() function to get 
the input from the user and convert it to an integer using the int() function. We will then create two empty 
sets to hold the multiples of 2 and 3.

Next, we will use a loop to generate the multiples of 2 and 3. We will iterate from 1 to N and multiply each number 
by 2 and 3 to generate the multiples. We will then add these multiples to their respective sets using the add() method.

Now, we need to generate the first subset - all the multiples of 2 but not the multiples of 3. We can do this 
by using the difference() method to find the difference between the two sets. This will give us all the elements
that are in multiples_of_2 but not in multiples_of_3. We will then convert this set to a list and sort 
it in ascending order.

Finally, we can print out the first subset using the print() function.

Next, we need to generate the second subset - all the uncommon multiples of 2 and 3. We can do this by using the 
symmetric_difference() method to find the symmetric difference between the two sets. This will give us all the 
elements that are in either multiples_of_2 or multiples_of_3, but not in both. We will then convert this set to 
a list and sort it in ascending order.

Finally, we can print out the second subset using the print() function.
Now that we have all the steps to solve the "Multiples of 2 and 3" problem, put them togather and solve the question.

Solution:

n = int(input())

multiples_of_2 = set()
multiples_of_3 = set()

for i in range(1, n+1):
    multiples_of_2.add(2*i)
    multiples_of_3.add(3*i)
    
diff = multiples_of_2.difference(multiples_of_3)
diff = list(diff)
diff.sort()

print(diff)

symmetric_diff = multiples_of_2.symmetric_difference(multiples_of_3)
symmetric_diff = list(symmetric_diff)
symmetric_diff.sort()

print(symmetric_diff)

06. Identify the Mistake - Convert a List to Tuple

Write a program to convert a list into a tuple.

Input:

The input will be a single line containing the comma-separated integers.

Output:

The output should be a single line containing the tuple with the list elements.

Explanation:

For example, if the given string is "5,10,15,20,25,30", your code should print the tuple
with the numbers present in the given string. So the output should be

(5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30)

Sample Input 1:

5,10,15,20,25,30

Sample Output 1:

(5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30)

Sample Input 2:

-18,10,20,50,40

Sample Output 2:

(-18, 10, 20, 50, 40)

Tutorial: Convert a List to Tuple in Python

In this tutorial, you will learn how to convert a list into a tuple in Python. We will break down the solution
into simple steps and explain each part in easy-to-understand language.

Step 1: Get the input
First, let's get the input from the user. We will use the input() function to read a line of text, which is 
a string containing comma-separated integers.

Step 2: Split the string
Now, let's split the string into a list of strings using the split() function. We will use a comma as the delimiter.

Step 3: Initialize a variable for index
Before we start converting each element of the list to an integer, let's initialize a variable to keep track 
of the index we are currently working on.

Step 4: Convert strings to integers
Next, we will use a for loop to go through each element in the list. We will convert each element from a 
string to an integer using the int() function. After converting, we will replace the original string with
the integer value in the list and increase the index by 1.

Step 5: Convert the list to a tuple
Now that we have a list of integers, we can convert it into a tuple. We will use the tuple() function to do this.

Step 6: Print the result
Finally, we will print the tuple containing the integers. We can simply use the print() function to display the result.

Now that we have all the steps, let's put them together into one complete program and solve the question.

Solution:

str_a = input()
a = str_a.split(",")
i = 0
for item in a:
    a[i] = int(item)
    i += 1
print(tuple(a))

07. Identify the Mistake - Add an Item to Set

For this problem, the prefilled code will contain a set. Write a program to add an word W to the set.

Input:

The input will be a single line containing a string (W).

Output:

The output should be a single line containing the list in ascending order.

Explanation:

For example, if the given word W is "pen", your code should add W to the set. So the output should be

["pen", "pencil"]

Sample Input 1:

pen

Sample Output 1:

["pen", "pencil"]

Sample Input 2:

notepad

Sample Output 2:

['notepad', 'pencil']

Tutorial: Identify the Mistake - Add an Item to Set

In this tutorial, you will learn how to add an item to a set in Python. We will go through the steps one by one,
so you can easily understand the process. Let's get started!

Step 1: Create a set with a single item
First, we need to create a set. In our example, we'll start with a set containing just one item: "pencil". 
Here's the code to do that:

Step 2: Get the input word from the user
Now, we need to get the input word (W) from the user. We can use the input() function to do this. Here's the code:

Step 3: Add the input word to the set
Next, we'll add the input word to our set. We can use the update() method to add an item to the set. But first, 
we need to put the word inside a list or another set, because the update() method only accepts lists or sets
as its argument. Here's the code:

Step 4: Convert the set to a list and sort it
We want to display the items in the set in ascending order. To do this, we first need to convert the set to a list.
Then, we can use the sort() method to sort the list. Here's the code:

Step 5: Print the sorted list
Finally, we can print the sorted list to display the output. Here's the code:

Now that we have all the steps, let's put them together into one complete program and solve the question.

Solution:

set_a = {"pencil"}

word = input()
set_a.update([word])

list_a = list(set_a)
list_a.sort()
print(list_a)
