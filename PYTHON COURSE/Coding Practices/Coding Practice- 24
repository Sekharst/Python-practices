Question: Sum of Numbers in the List
Given space-separated numbers, write a program to print the sum of the given numbers.

Input
The input will be a single line containing space-separated integers.

Output
The output should be a single line containing an integer that is the sum of the given numbers.

Explanation
For example, if the given space-separated numbers are 3 4 7 8,

The given numbers are 3, 4, 7, and 8.
The sum of 3, 4, 7, and 8 is 22. (3 + 4 + 7 + 8 = 22)
The output should be 22.

Approach
To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:

Read the input and split the numbers.
Convert the numbers to integers and store them in a new list.
Calculate the sum of the numbers in the list.
Print the sum of the numbers.

Step-by-Step Explanation

Step 1: Read the input and split the numbers

First, we need to read the input line containing space-separated integers. We can use the input() function 
to read the input. Then, we will use the split() function to split the input line into a list of strings.

Step 2: Convert the numbers to integers and store them in a new list

Now, we will create a new empty list called new_list. We will use a for loop to iterate through each number 
in the numbers_list. Inside the loop, we will convert each number from a string to an integer using the int() 
function. Then, we will add the converted integer to the new_list.

Step 3: Calculate the sum of the numbers in the list

After converting all the numbers to integers and storing them in the new_list, we can calculate the sum 
of the numbers using the sum() function.

PYTHON
Step 4: Print the sum of the numbers

Finally, we will print the sum of the numbers using the print() function.

Here is the complete solution for the problem:

Solution:

numbers_list = input().split()
new_list = []

for each_number in numbers_list:
    number = int(each_number)
    new_list += [number]
    
sum_of_numbers = sum(new_list)

print(sum_of_numbers)

Question: Largest Number in the List - 2

Write a program to print the largest number in the list. The input will be a single line containing the 
comma-separated integers. The output should be a single line containing the largest number in the list.

For example, if the given string is "2,4,-1,5", your code should print the largest number in the list. 
So the output should be 5.

Approach

To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:

Read the input and split the numbers.
Convert the numbers to integers.
Sort the list of numbers.
Find the largest number and print it.

Step-by-Step Explanation

Step 1: Read the input and split the numbers

First, we need to read the input, which is a single line containing comma-separated integers. We can use the input() 
function to read the input. Then, we will split the input string into a list of numbers using the split() function
with a comma (,) as the separator.

Step 2: Convert the numbers to integers

Now, we have a list of numbers as strings. We need to convert each number in the list to an integer. 
We can use a for loop to iterate through the list and the int() function to convert each number to an integer.

Step 3: Sort the list of numbers

Next, we need to sort the list of numbers in ascending order. We can use the sorted() function to sort the list.

Step 4: Find the largest number and print it

Finally, we can find the largest number in the sorted list by selecting the last element of the list 
(since it is sorted in ascending order). We can use the index -1 to access the last element of the list.
Then, we will print the largest number using the print() function.

Here is the complete solution for the problem:

Solution:

numbers = input()
nums_list = numbers.split(",")

length_of_nums_list = len(nums_list)
for i in range(length_of_nums_list):
    nums_list[i] = int(nums_list[i])

nums_list = sorted(nums_list)
largest_number = nums_list[-1]

The first line of output should contain the sum of digits in the given word.'
The second line of output should contain the minimum of digits in the given word.
The third line of output should contain the maximum of digits in the given word.

Explanation:

For example, if the given word is "C0d1n8", the digits in the given word are (0, 1, 8). 
Your code should print the sum, minimum and maximum in each line respectively. 

So the output should be

9
0
8

Sample Input 1:

C0d1n8

Sample Output 1:

9
0
8

Sample Input 2:

Pr08ra3mi2g

Sample Output 2:

13
0
8

Tutorial: Extract Digits

Step 1: Define a function to get the digits
First, we'll create a function called get_digits that takes a string as an input and returns a list of 
digits found in the string.

Explanation:
Create an empty list called digits_list to store the digits.
Loop through each character in the input string using a for loop.
Check if the character is a digit using the isdigit() method. If it is, convert the character to an integer 
and add it to the digits_list.

Step 2: Get the input string
Now, we'll ask the user to enter a string and store it in a variable called str_1.

Step 3: Extract the digits
We'll use the get_digits function that we created in Step 1 to extract the digits from the input string str_1.

Step 4: Calculate the sum, minimum, and maximum
Now that we have the digits in a list, we can calculate the sum, minimum, and maximum of these digits 
using Python's built-in functions sum(), min(), and max().

Step 5: Print the results
Finally, we'll print the sum, minimum, and maximum of the digits, each on a new line.

Now that we have all the steps, put them together and solve the question.

Solution:

def get_digits(str_1):
    digits_list = []
    for char in str_1:
        if char.isdigit():
            digits_list += [int(char)]
    return digits_list

str_1 = input()

digits = get_digits(str_1)

sum_of_digits = sum(digits)
min_of_digits = min(digits)
max_of_digits = max(digits)

print(sum_of_digits)
print(min_of_digits)
print(max_of_digits)

12. Identify The Mistake - Sort and Square the List It

Write a program to print the square of given list numbers in ascending order.

Input:

The input will be a single line containing the comma-separated integers.

Output:

The output should be a single line containing the list with the square of the numbers in ascending order.

Explanation:

For example, if the given string is "2, 4, 1, 3, 5", your code should print the square of the numbers
in ascending order. So the output should be

[1, 4, 9, 25]

Sample Input 1:

2,4,1,3,5

Sample Output 1:

[1, 4, 9, 16, 25]

Sample Input 2:

2,3,-1,5

Sample Output 2:

[1, 4, 9, 25]

Outline

Question: Identify The Mistake - Sort and Square the List It
Approach
Step 1: Read the input and split the numbers
Step 2: Calculate the square of each number
Step 3: Sort the squared numbers
Step 4: Print the sorted squared numbers

Question: Identify The Mistake - Sort and Square the List It

Write a program to print the square of given list numbers in ascending order. The input will be a 
single line containing the comma-separated integers. The output should be a single line containing
the list with the square of the numbers in ascending order.

For example, if the given string is "2, 4, 1, 3, 5", your code should print the square of the numbers
in ascending order. So the output should be:

Approach

Read the input and split the numbers by comma.
Calculate the square of each number in the list.
Sort the squared numbers in ascending order.
Print the sorted squared numbers.

Step-by-Step Explanation

Step 1: Read the input and split the numbers
Read the input using the input() function.
Split the input string by comma using the split() function.

Step 2: Calculate the square of each number
Create an empty list called list_x.
Use a for loop to iterate through each number in list_a.
Calculate the square of each number using int(num)**2 and add it to list_x.

Step 3: Sort the squared numbers
Sort the squared numbers in list_x using the sorted() function.

Step 4: Print the sorted squared numbers
Print the sorted squared numbers using the print() function.

Solution:

list_a=input()
list_x = list_a.split(',')
for num in range (len(list_x)):
    list_x[num]= int(list_x[num])**2

print(sorted(list_x))
