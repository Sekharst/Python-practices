Given a number having ten digits, convert it to a string following the below-mentioned rules.

Rules for conversion:

Separate the number into a set of four-three-three digits
Use the following prefixes for successive digits
    Single numbers: just read them separately.
    Two Consecutive numbers: double
    Three Consecutive numbers: triple
    Four Consecutive numbers: quadruple

Input

The first line of input is a string of ten digits.

Output

The output should print the given number in a human-readable format.
Refer to the sample input and output.

Explanation

In the example, the first test case number is 9887666668 and this number should be divided into 4-3-3 format.
By separating the number in the dividing format the number will be like

4        3       3
9887    666     668

The first divided part should be read as nine for 9.And double eight as there are two consecutive 8 's 9 it
In the second divided part, there are three consecutive 6 's, it should be read as triple six
In the third divided part should be read as double six  as there are two consecutive 6 's and then 8  separately.

So, the total number should be read as 

nine double eight seven triple six double six eight
