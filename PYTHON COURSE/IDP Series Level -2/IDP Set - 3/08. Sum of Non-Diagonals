As a member of the creative content team for a newspaper company, your task is to publish a puzzle. 
The puzzle involves finding the sum of all elements in a square matrix of size M X M, excluding the 
numbers on both diagonals.

Write a program that reads an M X M matrix and prints the sum of all elements other than the elements on the both diagonals.

Input

The first line of input contains an integer representing M.
The next M lines of input contain M space-separated integers representing the M X M matrix.

Output

The output should be a single line containing an integer obtained by adding all the elements 
other than elements on both diagonals.

Explanation

TestCase: For example, if the given M = 3, the given 3 x 3 matrix as follows:

4 1 3 
2 5 6
1 2 3

In the first row, the non-diagonal element is 1
In the second row, the non-diagonal elements are 2 and 6
In the third row, the non-diagonal element is 2.

The sum of the non-diagonal elements is,

1 + 2 + 6 + 2 = 11

So the output should be 11.

Sample Input 1

3
4 1 3
2 5 6
1 2 3

output

11

Sample Input 2

5
1 2 2 3 3
4 4 5 6 7
9 8 7 6 5
9 2 3 0 0
-4 -2 -2 4 -7

output

63

Solution

 def read_matrix(m):
    matrix = []
    for i in range(m):
        row = list(map(int, input().split()))
        matrix.append(row)
    return matrix

def get_sum_of_elements_satisfies_conditions(matrix, m):
    sum_of_elements = 0 
    for i in range(m):
        for j in range(m):
            if((i != j) and (i + j) != (m - 1)):
                sum_of_elements += matrix[i][j]
    return sum_of_elements
    
def main():        
    m = int(input())
    matrix = read_matrix(m)
    sum_of_elements = get_sum_of_elements_satisfies_conditions(matrix, m)
    print(sum_of_elements)
    
main()

n=int(input())

sum=0
for i in range(n):
    m=list(map(int,input().split()))
    lista.append(m)
for i in range(len(lista)):

        if i==j or i+j==n-1:
            pass
        else:
            sum+=lista[i][j]
