Your friend John has been given a sentence S  and asked to modify it by replacing each letter with its previous letter 
in the alphabet as shown in the table (A becomes Z, B becomes A, etc.).

﻿Letter     Previous letter

A              Z
B              A
C              B
...            ...
Z              Y
a              z
b              a
c              b
z              y

Your task is to help John in modifying the sentence.

Write a program that reads the sentence S, and prints the modified sentence by replacing each letter 
with its previous letter in the alphabet.

Input

The input will be a single line containing a string representing the sentence s.

Output

The output should be a single line containing a string representing the modified sentence.

Explanation

TestCase: If the given sentence is Fourty Nine, 
The previous letter of F is E, similarly replace each letter with the previous letter.

﻿Letter     Previous letter

F              E
o              n
u              t
r              q
t              s
y              x

N              M
i              h
n              m
e              d

The output should be Entqsx Mhmd.

Sample Input 1

Fourty Nine

output

Entqsx Mhmd 

Sample Input 2

Curious brain learns fast

output

Btqhntr aqzhm kdzqmr ezrs
