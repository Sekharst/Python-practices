You have given an N X N matrix, where N is a number. You need to find the sum of all elements in the matrix that satisfy 
either of the following conditions.

1. The row and column indices of an element should be the same.
2. The sum of the row and column indices of an element should be equal to the value N-1.

For example, if the given number N = 3, and the given matrix is:

1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9

The elements that satisfy the 1st condition are 1, 5, and 9.
The elements that satisfy the 2nd condition are 3, 5, and 7.

The sum of all these elements is 25.

Write a program that reads an N X N matrix and prints the sum of elements that satisfy either of the given conditions.

Note: 

Row and Column are zero index-based
If an element satifies both conditions, it will only be considered once in the final sum.

Input

The first line of input contains an integer N.
The next N  lines of input contain N space-separated integers representing the N X N matrix.

Output

The output should be a single line containing an integer representing the sum of elements that satisfy 
either of the given conditions.

Explanation

TestCase: If the given number N = 3, and the given matrix is: 

10 12 13
14 15 16
17 18 19

ï»¿
Here,

10(0, 0), 15(1, 1), and 19(2, 2) satisfies the 1st condition.

13(0+2=2), 15(1+1=2), and 17 (2+0=2) satisfies the 2nd condition.

Here, the element 15 satisfies both conditions, i.e, it will only be considered once in the final sum.

The elements that satisfy either of the given conditions are 10, 13, 15, 17, and 19.

The sum of elements is

10+13 + 15 + 17+ 19 = 74

The output should be 74.
