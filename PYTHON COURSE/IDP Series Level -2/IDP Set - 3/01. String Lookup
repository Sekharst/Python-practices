Solution

def read_sentences(n):
    sentences_list = []
    for i in range(n):
        sentence = input().split() 
        sentences_list.append(sentence)
    return sentences_list

def find_the_sentence_contains_the_word(sentences_list, word):
    for index in range(len(sentences_list)): 
        if word in sentences_list[index]:
            sentence_postion = index + 1
            return sentence_postion
    return -1
    
def main():
    word = input()
    no_of_sentences = int(input())
    sentences_list = read_sentences(no_of_sentences)
    sentence_postion = find_the_sentence_contains_the_word(sentences_list, word)
    print(sentence_postion)
    
main()
