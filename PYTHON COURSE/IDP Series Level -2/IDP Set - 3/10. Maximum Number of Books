There are multiple( T ) bookstores in the area. Each shopkeeper has a list of B
integers that represents the cost of each book. You have different pocket money( P) for each bookstore.
 
 Write a program to calculate the maximum number of books you can buy in each store with the corresponding pocket money.

Input

The first line of input is a positive integer T that represents the number of shops.
The following lines represent the details of the T shops.
Each set of two consecutive lines represents the details of a shop.
The first line of each set contains two space-separated integers B and P.
The second line of each set contains B space-separated integers.

Output

The output should be T lines.
Each line contains an integer that represents the maximum number of books that can be bought in each shop.

Explanation

TestCase: For example, if the given P = 600 and B = [120, 140, 110, 180, 120, 110]

With a pocket money of 600, we can buy the books at index 0,1,2,4,5 whose sum is 120 + 140 + 110 + 120 + 100 
is equal to P

given P = 300 and B = [120, 110, 1300, 130]
With a pocket money of 300, we can buy the books at index 0,1 whose sum is 120 + 110
is less than P

given P = 100 and B = [220, 1000, 500, 2000]
With a pocket money of 100, we cannot buy the books 

So the output should be, 

5
