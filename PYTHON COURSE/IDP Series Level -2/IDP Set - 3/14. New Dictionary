Peter is making a new dictionary. He wants to arrange the words in the ascending order of their 
length and later arrange the ones with the same length in lexicographic order. Each word is given a 
serial number according to its position. Find the word according to the serial number.

The serial number of words in Peter's dictionary is as follows

Word            Serial Number

A                    1
B                    2
C                    3
...                  ...
X                    24
Y                    25
Z                    26
AA                   27
AB                   28
...                  ...
BA                   53
...                  ...
ZZ                   702
AAA                  703
...                  ...

Input

The first line of input is a positive integer which is the serial number.

Output

The output should be a single line containing the word that represents the serial number.

Explanation

Given serial number is 42

As the serial number is between 26 and 52, the first character of the word is A. 
The remaining counter of the serial number is 16 (42 - 26).

The second character of the word is the 16th alphabet, which is P

So the output should be AP.

Sample Input 1

42

output

AP

Sample Input 2

751

output

ABW

Solution

ALPHABET_LETTERS = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"

def get_the_word_from_serial_number(serial_number):
    final_word = ""
    while serial_number > 0:
        remainder = serial_number % 26
        if remainder == 0:
            alphabet = ALPHABET_LETTERS[25]
            serial_number = serial_number - 26
        else:
            alphabet = ALPHABET_LETTERS[remainder-1]
            serial_number = serial_number - remainder
        final_word = alphabet + final_word
        serial_number = serial_number // 26
    return final_word

def main():
    serial_number = int(input())
    word = get_the_word_from_serial_number(serial_number)
    print(word)
    
main()

n=int(input())
s=''
while n>0:
    n-=1 
    s=chr(n%26+65)+s 
    n=n//26
print(s)
