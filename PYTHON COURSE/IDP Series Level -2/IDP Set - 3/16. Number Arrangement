Each student from the kindergarten was given a word or a number. They were made to stand in such a way 
that their words/numbers made an actual sentence. Later the students that have numbers are told to 
shuffle among themselves such that they appear in decreasing order when the whole sentence is read. 
Find the sentence formed after they rearranged themselves in the said order.

Note: There will not be any negative numbers or numbers with the decimal part.

Input

The input is a string containing the actual sentence.

Output

The output is a string containing the modified sentence as mentioned above.

Explanation

For example, if the actual sentence is  It is a 3days 4nights holiday trip

The numbers in the sentence are 3 and 4. After arranging them in decreasing order, the output looks like 

It is a 4days 3nights holiday trip


Sample Input

It is a 3days 4nights holiday trip

output

It is a 4days 3nights holiday trip
