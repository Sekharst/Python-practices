The challenge is that Shyam is given numbers, Shyam should find the largest negative number 
that is missing from the given numbers. Help Shyam to win this challenge.

Write a program that reads space-separated numbers and print the largest negative number missing from given numbers.

Input

The input will be a single line containing space-separated integers representing the numbers.

Output

The output should be a single line containing an integer that is the largest negative number missing from the given numbers.

Explanation

Test Case: If the given numbers -3 -1 -2 -5 -3 -7 -7,

The largest negative number missing from the given numbers is -4

The output should be -4

Solution

def get_missing_number(numbers):
    missing_number = -1
    for each_number in range(1, len(numbers)):
        if missing_number not in numbers:
            break
        missing_number = missing_number - 1
    return missing_number
    
def main():    
    numbers = list(map(int, input().split()))
    missing_number = get_missing_number(numbers)
    print(missing_number)
    
main()
